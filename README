Description:
Design a BDD Test automation Framework with Selenium WebDriver + Java + Maven + TestNg

Guidelines:

1. Intellij should be used as an IDE.
2. Selenium 4 will be used
3. All the data inputs should be feed from an external excel file data source.
4. Page object model design pattern should be there.
5. Following Common exceptions should be handle properly:
    * WebDriver Exception               * NoSuchElementException
    *ElementNotVisibleException         * TimeoutException             *StaleElementReferenceException
6. Take a screenshot when a test failed.
7. Tests should be executed on Chrome and Firefox browsers.
8. Tests should be executed in headless browser.
9. Tests should be executed from linux terminal from mvn command. (Should -not execute from intellij)
10. Proper wait should be there no thread.sleep should be used.
11. Add README file as well.

Solution:

To run this assignment, there are two ways:
a. Run the below command in command prompt to run t he tests and to get the test execution report.
   ->   mvn test

b. A Runner class to run the tests. This class will use the TestNG annotation @RunWith(), which tells TestNG what is the test runner class.
AbstractTestNGCucumberTests â€“ Runs each cucumber scenario found in the features as separated test.
